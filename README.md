# Even Number Checker

This is a simple executable program written in Haskell that checks if a given number is even. It demonstrates the use of Haskell's data types `Maybe` and `Either` to handle different cases, such as when the number is even or odd. The program is also integrated with Nix Flakes for easy project management.

## Features

- Checks if a number is even.
- Demonstrates the use of Haskell's `Maybe` and `Either` data types.
- Integrates with Nix Flakes for project management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/)
- [Cabal (Common Architecture for Building Applications and Libraries)](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/even-number-checker.git


1. Change directory to the project folder:

cd even-number-checker

2. Build the project using Cabal:

cabal build

3. Run the program:

cabal run EvenNumberChecker




Usage
The program will prompt you to enter a number.
It will then check if the entered number is even and display the result.

Example:

Even Number Checker
Enter a number: 4
Number 4 is even.
